# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
PyBer co-founder, V. Isualize, has requested a summary of the company’s ride-sharing data by city type, and a visual that illustrates the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results
By using Pandas and Matplotlib, we were able to analyze the company’s ride-sharing data and produce the following outputs:
- PyBer Summary

- Total Fare by City Type

## Summary
From our analysis, we are able to make the following recommendations to V.Isualize:

-	Allocate more drivers to Rural and Suburban cities.
-	Allocate less drivers to Urban cities.

This could help drive the average fare per driver in Urban cities up and may potentially increase the number of rides in Rural and Suburban cities. More rides in Rural and Suburban may also lead to increased total fares.
