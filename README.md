# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
PyBer co-founder, V. Isualize, has requested a summary of the company’s ride-sharing data by city type, and a visual that illustrates the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results
By using Pandas and Matplotlib, we were able to analyze the company’s ride-sharing data and produce the following outputs:
- PyBer Summary

- Total Fare by City Type

![Total Fare_by_City_Type](/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)



## Summary
From our analysis, we can see that the cost of ride-sharing per ride is more expensive in Rural and Suburban cities. Also, unlike Urban cities, Rural and Suburban cities have lower driver counts than total rides. In order to help improve total fares in Rural and Suburban cities, V.Isusalize may need to come up with strategies to:

- Make ride-sharing more affordable in Rural and Suburban cities.
- Allocate more drivers to Rural and Suburban cities.
-	Allocate less drivers to Urban cities.

By moving drivers to Rural and Suburban cities at more affordable fares, people may choose to use the service more often. This will improve total rides and ultimately increase total fares.
